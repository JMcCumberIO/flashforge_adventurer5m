# Code Review and Refinement Summary

This document summarizes the key changes implemented based on a comprehensive code review performed on [Date - placeholder, ideally replace with actual date if known, otherwise omit or use a generic phrase like 'recently']. The goal of these changes was to improve code quality, maintainability, robustness, and adherence to Home Assistant development best practices.

## Key Improvements by File:

### 1. `const.py` (Constants Management)
- **Removed Unused Constants**: Eliminated numerous constants that were no longer in use across the integration (e.g., old state definitions, redundant local unit strings, unused error codes).
- **Added New Constants**:
    - Defined constants for API attribute keys (e.g., `API_ATTR_STATUS`, `API_ATTR_DETAIL`) to replace hardcoded strings in other files.
    - Added constants for MJPEG camera settings (e.g., `MJPEG_DEFAULT_PORT`, `MJPEG_STREAM_PATH`).
    - Introduced constants for TCP command path prefixes used in `coordinator.py` (e.g., `TCP_CMD_PRINT_FILE_PREFIX_USER`).
    - Added constants for new Endstop and Bed Leveling binary sensors (API attribute keys, names, icons).

### 2. `binary_sensor.py`
- **Error Handling**: Implemented safer conversion of `printProgress` data by adding a `try-except ValueError` block.
- **Entity Definitions**: Assigned more specific `device_class` (e.g., `POWER`, `RUNNING`) and `entity_category` (e.g., `CONFIG`, `DIAGNOSTIC`) for newly added binary sensors (Auto Shutdown, Fans).
- **Logging**: Added debug logging for cases where coordinator data is unavailable during state determination.
- **Maintainability**: Replaced hardcoded API attribute strings with the newly defined constants from `const.py`.
- **New Sensors Added**: Implemented binary sensors for X, Y, Z endstops, a filament runout sensor, and bed leveling status, based on data fetched by the coordinator.

### 3. `camera.py`
- **Initialization**: Modified `MjpegCamera` initialization to use `mjpeg_url=None` if no valid stream URL is available at startup, preventing the base class from attempting connections to a dummy URL.
- **Maintainability**: Replaced hardcoded MJPEG settings and API attribute strings with constants from `const.py`.
- **Logging**: Added specific debug logging when the camera is marked unavailable due to a missing or invalid stream URL.

### 4. `sensor.py`
- **Entity Definitions**:
    - Adjusted `device_class` for the "printProgress" sensor to `SensorDeviceClass.BATTERY`.
    - Changed `state_class` for the "nozzleStyle" sensor to `None` (assuming textual data).
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error logging for percentage conversion failures, including more context and full exception information.
- **Maintainability**: Replaced hardcoded API attribute strings (e.g., for firmware version) with constants from `const.py`.

### 5. `coordinator.py`
- **Refactoring**: Centralized TCP command sending logic by refactoring common operations into a new private helper method (`_send_tcp_command`), reducing code duplication.
- **Robustness**:
    - Added detailed comments explaining the expected M661 (file list) response format.
    - Made M661 parsing more defensive with additional checks and improved warning/debug logging for unexpected scenarios.
- **Maintainability**: Replaced hardcoded TCP `start_print` path prefixes and some API attribute strings with constants from `const.py`.
- **New Data Fetching**:
    - Implemented `_fetch_endstop_status` to send `~M119` and parse X, Y, Z, and filament endstop states.
    - Implemented `_fetch_bed_leveling_status` to send `~M420 S0` and parse bed leveling active status.
    - Integrated these new fetch methods into the main data update cycle.
- **Removed Temporary Code**: Deleted diagnostic test code for `~M115` and `~M420 V` commands.

### 6. `flashforge_tcp.py`
- **Clarity**: Added inline comments to explain:
    - The rationale and implications of using `errors='ignore'` in `response.decode()`.
    - The "connect-send-close" design strategy of the TCP client and its trade-offs.

### 7. `config_flow.py`
- **Code Simplification**: Removed redundant manual `scan_interval` range validation in the options flow (already handled by `vol.Schema`).
- **Best Practices**: Changed the timeout mechanism in `_test_printer_connection` to use `aiohttp.ClientTimeout` for more idiomatic `aiohttp` error handling.
- **Error Handling**: Refined exception handling in `_test_printer_connection` to catch more specific `aiohttp` errors and removed a potentially unreachable `raise` statement.

### 8. `manifest.json`
- **Metadata**:
    - Updated the `documentation` URL to point directly to the `README.md` file for easier access to information.
    - Removed `aiohttp` from `requirements` as it's a core Home Assistant dependency and no specific version was required.

### 9. `__init__.py`
- **Code Simplification**: Removed redundant type conversions (e.g., `int()`, `float()`) in service handlers, relying on `vol.Schema` for type coercion.

### 10. General Code Quality
- **Type Hinting**: Addressed various type hinting issues identified by MyPy, primarily by using `Optional` for parameters with `None` defaults and adding explicit annotations for some instance variables and return types.
- **Formatting & Linting**: Applied Black and Ruff for consistent code formatting and to fix minor linting issues.

These changes collectively enhance the stability, maintainability, and overall quality of the `flashforge_adventurer5m` custom integration.

## New Features Added (Post-Review Enhancements)

This section details new sensors and functionalities added after the initial code review and fixes.

### 1. Endstop Status Sensors
- Binary sensors have been added to monitor the status of the printer's endstops:
    - **X Endstop**: Indicates if the X-axis endstop is triggered or open.
    - **Y Endstop**: Indicates if the Y-axis endstop is triggered or open.
    - **Z Endstop**: Indicates if the Z-axis endstop is triggered or open.
    - **Filament Sensor**: Indicates if the filament runout sensor (if present and reported by `~M119`) is triggered or open.
- These sensors derive their state from the output of the `~M119` G-code command.
- An "on" state typically means the endstop is "triggered," while "off" means "open."

### 2. Bed Leveling Status Sensor
- A new binary sensor, "Bed Leveling Active," has been added.
- This sensor reports whether bed leveling compensation is currently active on the printer.
- The state is derived from the output of the `~M420 S0` G-code command (or a similar query).
- An "on" state means bed leveling is active, and "off" means it is inactive.
